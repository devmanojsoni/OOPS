/*
    It is just a style of developing applications
    other styles are also there like in C we use 
    structural/procedural/modular programming
    Oject Oriented programming is very famous & popular
    Object Orientation is more related to the internal designing of a software
    Its nowhere related to the user of your software, it's related to the
    programmers who are developing a software

    Bank                                            Government
    Modular Programming                             Object Oriented (Collection of (Collection of Functions))
    ===================                             ===================
    openAcc()                                       Electricity Department: openNewConnection(), payBill()
    deposit()                                       closeConnection()
    withdraw()                                      
    checkBal()                                      Water Department: 
    applyLoan()                                     payWaterBill()
    etc                                             
    .                                               Education Department:
    .                                               noOfProffessorsinIITs()
    .                                               noOfIITs()
    So, Bank Application will in the                   
    form of collection of functions                 Bank Department:
    and the user of this application will           bankName()
    be using these functions to perform             noOfBanks()
    some required tasks                             openAcc.in.HDFCBank()
    .                                               deposit.in.HDFCBank(Acc, CustomerID)                                                
    So, In Modular Programming, you will            
    develop an application in the form of           Electricity functions are related to electricity depart,
    set of functions                                Water related functions are related to water depart,
    .                                               Education related funcstions are related to electric department
                                                    Similarly, Bank related functions are related to the
                                                    Banking System.

                                                    So, A Complete software written using OOP paradigm
                                                    is a collection of objects, these objects contains
                                                    functions as well as data related to those functions

    Here we are looking at a closer level           Whereas, here we are looking far away, if we look closer
                                                    at every bundle, we'll find a set of functions

    Clearly, it is suitable for small               Clearly it is suitable for large scale systems
